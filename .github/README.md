Another fabric mod to add controller support to Minecraft Java - with a focus on compatibility.

## Why another?

Yes, mods like [Midnight Controls](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnight-controls) already exist. However due to the fact it
was forked from a now abandoned project, its codebase is a mess and adding compatibility for it ultimately drove me to
create this mod!

## Features

### Controller vibration

Controlify supports controller vibration, which has not been seen before for PC versions of Minecraft,
including Bedrock Windows 10 Edition. Configure the intensity of each vibration source, with
complex vibration patterns for lots of aspects of the game (e.g. when you take damage).

### Built-in gyro support

Controlify has built-in support for controller gyroscopes, allowing you to make fine movements in-game
with your controller. This can be combined with [flick stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bw5xct/flick_stick_is_a_new_way_to_control_3d_games_with/) to be able to use a controller without
the compromise.

### Controller identification

Controlify has the ability to identify the make and model of your controller automatically,
and displays relevant button textures for your controller. This is also customizable, and 
resource packs can add their own controller textures.

### Joystick support

You can connect any joystick and create your own mappings for it, allowing you to display custom
textures for your joystick. These mappings are powered through resourcepacks, allowing creators
to create mappings for everyone.

### Container cursor

Just like in bedrock edition, you can move a cursor across your inventory, and interact
with it in a controller-friendly way.

### Button guide

The button guide is a simple overlay in-game that displays the buttons you can press
based on your player's state and look direction. This is useful for new players, who
have not yet memorised the controls.

### Containerised Controllers

This mod is built around the fact that each controller is completely separate, with it's own configuration, bindings etc.
This means it will be trivial to add support for split-screen play in the future.

### Built for mod compatibility

GUI operation has been abstracted into a simple API, which allows other mods to easily add support for their own GUIs,
without convoluted support throughout the whole mod's codebase, making it difficult for third parties to integrate.

### Automatic controller deadzone calibration

The deadzone values of your controller are automatically calibrated, 
meaning you don't have to worry about it.

## What is to come?

You can see the [project board](https://github.com/users/isXander/projects/3) which has a list of planned features.

## Backports?

This mod is only and will only be available for **1.19.4** and above, this is because in 1.19.4, Mojang
introduced arrow key navigation which was easily ported to controller, below 1.19.4, this is not possible.

## License

This mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](/LICENSE).
