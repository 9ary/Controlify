# Controlify 1.5.1 for 1.20.1

## New Features

- Added Simple Voice Chat support. You can now bind push-to-talk and whisper
  to your controller and it will work properly. Radial menus have custom icons
  for some SVC actions.
- Added radial menus to the API completely.

## Changes

- Made rumble effects merge together rather than pausing each other when multiple effects
  are playing at once.
- Slightly increased the values the auto-deadzone calibration gives you.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the radial up/down/left/right bindings not having a localised name.

## Language Updates

- Updated Chinese translation.
