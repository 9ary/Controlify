# Controlify 1.4.2 for 1.20

## New Features

- Added a 'Maybe Later' button to the calibration screen, which will close the screen and not calibrate the controller.
- Added a 'Mixed Input' option which allows you to make any controller behave like the Steam Deck.
- Implement SDL controller identification when `hid4java` is unavailable (on macOS ARM).

## Changes

- Controller rumble is silenced whilst the window is out of focus, rather than the previous behaviour where all
  rumble effects were cancelled.
- Optimize rumble driver calls to not send every tick if unnecessary.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix the controller default config syncing with the normal config after a serialization failure.
