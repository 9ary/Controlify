# Controlify 1.3.1 for 1.20

## Additions

- Added new setting to have a custom scale for the in-game button guide hud. This is relative to the Minecraft
  gui scale setting.
- Better Steam Deck handling, allowing simultaneous use of Steam Input features like mouse gyro emulation
  and touchpads. This is temporary until the Steam Deck driver is finished.

## Changes

- Reimplement immediately-fast compatibility that was temporarily removed in 1.20 betas. Your button guides should
  be a little more performant now.
