# Controlify 1.2

## New Features

- Container button guide - just like bedrock edition
- Button guides and shortcuts for the title screen and pause menu
- Controller bind conflict detection - binds that conflict with each other are highlighted in red
- Battery level warning as a toast. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- Controller vibration & gyro support on macOS
- A toast is now displayed when your primary controller was connected and automatically switched to.

## Changes

- Cursor snapping is now instant
- Only print debug info if non-default
- Removed 'VMouse Escape' bind in favour of GUI back.
- Removed vanilla overrides for: swap hands, inventory, change perspective, show player list. 
  This means nothing to the user but may reduce bugs.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix rumble reported as unsupported when it's just off
- Fixed a bug where the logs were spammed on Steam Deck devices
- Fix hidden mouse hovering over buttons in the centre of the screen
- Fix rare crash
