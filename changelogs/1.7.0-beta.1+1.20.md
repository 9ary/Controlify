# Controlify 1.7.0 (Beta 1) for 1.20.1

This patch focuses on stability and controller compatibility.

## Changes

- Switched to Java Native Access (JNA) from Java Native Interface (JNI) for SDL2 native library.
  - This should fix issues on Linux and macOS when loading SDL2.
  - This makes adding more features with SDL2 easier in the future.
- Provided `gamecontrollerdb.txt` to SDL and GLFW to (hopefully) improve controller compatibility.
- Controller calibration now detects triggers on joysticks. You must re-calibrate your controller for this to take effect.
- Added an SDL download screen that appears with a progress bar when downloading SDL2 for the first time or an update.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix pressing F3-Esc crashing when a controller is active.
- Fix [Immediately Fast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast) compatibility causing extreme log spam.
- Fix generic XInput controllers being identified as 8BitDo an controller.
