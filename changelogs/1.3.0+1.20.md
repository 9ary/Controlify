# Controlify 1.3 for 1.20

## New Features

### Server-side support

Controlify now has server-side support, meaning it is now recommended to install Controlify on your server.

### `/vibratecontroller` command

This command allows you to make players' controllers vibrate. You can specify the intensity of both the
low frequency and high frequency motors, and the duration of the vibration.

You can select to either do a simple vibration, or place the vibration in world-space (either bound to an entity or position)
with a range to have the vibration intensity decrease with distance.

```
/vibratecontroller <receivers> <low_freq_intensity> <high_freq_intensity> <duration_ticks> <(static|positioned)> [<range>] [<(position|entity>]

/vibratecontroller @a 0 0.25 200 positioned 10 ~ ~ ~
/vibratecontroller @a 0.75 1 50 static
/vibratecontroller @a 0.75 1 20 positioned 10 @e[type=minecraft:warden,sort=nearest,limit=1]
/execute as @e[type=!minecraft:player] run vibratecontroller @a 1 0 5 positioned 20 @s
```

This comes with a client option in global settings to ignore these server requests to vibrate.

### Reach-around policy

When Controlify is stored in the server, by default, the reach-around policy is set to `disallow`. You can
allow reach-around placement on your server by setting the `reach_around_policy` config option to `true`.

## Bug Fixes
