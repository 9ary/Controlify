# Controlify 1.7.0 (Beta 3) for 1.20.2

## New Features

- Added D-Pad snapping in container screens
- Keyboard-like movement whitelist and warning toast when joining new servers
- Added bind to open F3 debug screen
- More snap points on recipe book
- Allow users to define a custom SDL natives path (so you can put them in a common dir if you want)
- Add a reset all binds button to controls tab

## Changes

- Internal changes to the way controllers are discovered, loaded and managed. (this could introduce new bugs)
- `delegate_setup` config option has been renamed to `quiet_mode`.
- Pause screen's disconnect shortcut now focuses the button instead of clicking it.
- Add a donate button to the controller carousel screen.
- Modify how analogue inputs are processed whilst ingame or using the virtual mouse to make it feel more "circular"
- Marginally improve performance of Controlify by using optimized hashmaps.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix hotplugging when using natives.
- Fix SDL download screen progress bar being a missing texture.
- Fix people being unable to write newlines and spaces in signs when using mixed input mode.
- Fix some modded GUIs crashing when attempting to open when Controlify is loaded.
- Fix tridents not causing a vibration.
- Fix rumble not working on joysticks.
- Fix fabric mod json requirement allowing any 1.20 version not 1.20.2 and above.
