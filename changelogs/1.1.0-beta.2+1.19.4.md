# Controlify 1.1 (Beta 2)

## New Vibrations

- **Explosions** now cause a vibration. 
  Their intensity is scaled based on the explosion's distance from the player and power.
  This is a cool custom effect where you feel an initial boom, and then another fading vibration.
- **Survival block mining** now causes a vibration. The intensity is scaled based on the block's hardness.
- **Item break** now causes a vibration.
- **Fishing rod fish bite** now causes a vibration.

## Vibration Changes

A new continuous vibration effect has been added. This allows for more complex
vibrations over a non-specific duration. This means an overhaul of some vibrations:

- Bow draw vibration now feels like a real bow draw with a slight wobble on max charge (like the animation).
- Crossbow load vibration now matches the animation.
- Eating vibration now matches the animation.

Also, vibrations now play nicely together, where playing a vibration over a longer vibration does
not cause the longer vibration to stop, but pause.


## Bug Fixes

- Fix the health vibration sometimes not playing.
- Fix controllers not being detected half the time on startup.
- Fix unidentified controllers not being able to save configs.
