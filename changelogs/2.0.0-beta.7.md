# Controlify 2.0.0 (Beta 7)

This version has the following builds - make sure you select the right one for your Minecraft version:
- 1.20.1
- 1.20.4
- 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)

## On-screen keyboard

This build adds a new on-screen keyboard that is currently only available in the chat screen.

This replaces the old functionality of attempting to open the system keyboard which could lead to the game
window being minimized or the keyboard being hidden behind the window.

This feature is currently experimental, and can be disabled per-controller in the settings menu.
The layout is not final and feedback is appreciated while I continue to improve it such as the layout.

Yes, it is planned that this keyboard will automatically appear for any other text input fields in the future.

## Other changes

- Add DualSense mute button light integration with simple voice chat mod.
- Re-enable mod compatibilities on 1.20.6 build. (except Iris for now)
- Update the SDL controller mapping definitions

## Bug fixes

- Fix crash when pressing B on the title screen and other glitches with buttons in menus.
- Fix rumble master volume not doing anything
- Fix DualShock 4 and DualShock 3 icons not working.
